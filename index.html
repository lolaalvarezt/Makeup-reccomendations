				<h3 class="notbold">Oily skin can be hard to manage. People with oily skin already have a natural dewy look, sadly, this is not a pleasent feeling on your face. Especially, since that "dewy look" is grease. People with this type of skin should look for a matte finish. Products that leave a matte finish are your go-to if this is your issue.</h3></td>
			<td width="30%"><h2 class="bold">Mixed skin</h2>
				<h3 class="notbold">Mixed skin can be tricky to manage. People with combination skin often deal with both oily and dry areas. This mix can make it hard to find products that balance everything out. Look for formulas that control shine without drying out your skin. A natural or semi-matte finish is your best friend. It keeps the oily areas in check while still giving your skin a healthy, balanced glow.</h3></td>
			<td width="30%"><h2 class="bold">Dry Skin</h2><h3 class="notbold">Dry skin can be tough to manage. People with dry skin often struggle with tightness, flakiness, or a dull appearance. Unlike oily skin, the main challenge here is keeping your face moisturized. Look for products that hydrate and nourish, leaving your skin soft and smooth. A dewy or luminous finish is ideal, it helps your skin look healthy and radiant while giving it that much-needed boost of hydration.</h3></td>
